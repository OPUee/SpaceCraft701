## The Project ##
The actual purpose of the project is to create a medium sized 2D arcade shooting
game, playing in space. But on that way I also want to give a try on abstracting 
some basic functionality and create a really basic and rudimentary game engine

## The Story ##
coming soon  

## Features ##

### Engine ###
- runtime engine for updateing scene
- prepared panels meant to be screnes
- sprite abstraction to simply create in-game objects
- relative layout in scene and sprites
- collider objects for an efficient collision detection
- predefined animator classes to create fancy looking 2D animations
- skybox for infinite scrolling backgrounds

### Game ###
- little technical preview

## Comming up ##

### Engine ###
- simple specialisation of the LowBobSprite class to UI Elements.
- rudimentary implementation of "kind of illumination" points for a fancy look.
- possibility to play sounds.

### Game ###
- apply explosion animations on destroied alien ships.
- advanced steering for players spacecraft.
- simple "AI" for enemies.
- end boss.
- sounds would really be great..
