# SpaceCraft701 #

## The Project ##
The actual purpose of the project is to create a really simple and basic game
engine for 2D Games. But on that way I also want to develop a medium sized 
arcade shooting game, playing in space. Call this SpaceCraft701.

## The Story ##
coming soon  

## Features ##
### Engine ###
- simple specialisation of the LowBobSprite class to UI Elements.
- rudimentary implementation of "kind of illumination" points for a fancy look.
- possibility to play sounds.

### Technical Preview ###
- animation of the background (could be a issue for the engine).
- apply explosion animations on destroied alien ships.
- advanced steering for players spacecraft.
- simple "AI" for enemies.
- end boss.
- sounds would really be great..
