## The Project ##
The actual purpose of the project is to create a medium sized 2D arcade shooting
game, playing in space. But on that way I also want to give a try on abstracting 
some basic functionality and create a really basic and rudimentary game engine

## The Story ##
coming soon  

## Features ##

### Engine ###
- runtime engine for updateing scene
- prepared panels meant to be screnes

- predefined animator classes to create fancy looking 2D animations
- skybox for infinite scrolling backgrounds
- ui elements for menu and hud visualisation
